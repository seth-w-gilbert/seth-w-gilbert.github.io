Ender's Game	Orson Scott Card	20	Intense and unique.  I was engaged the whole time.
The Giver	Lois Lowry	20	Dark and thought-provoking.  Lowry explores the personal, interal issues with Utopia.
Moby Dick	Herman Mellville	15	Long and meandering.  I think I may have had the wrong attitude when I read it.  Would recommend to retirees.
Foundation	Isaac Asimov	19	Only the start of the story, but it keeps you engaged.
