Ender's Game	Orson Scott Card	20	Intense and unique.  I was engaged the whole time.
Speaker for the Dead	Orson Scott Card	20	The start of a new story for Ender. A great look into relationships between people both alike and unalike.
Frankenstein	Mary Shelley	20	Much better than I expected.  Well worth the read, but not for the fragile hearted.
The Prodigal God	Timothy Keller	20	Challenging study of a famous parable. Which son do you relate most with?
The Giver	Lois Lowry	19	Dark and thought-provoking.  Lowry explores the personal, interal issues with Utopia.
Foundation	Isaac Asimov	19	Only the start of the story, but it keeps you engaged.
The Judas Strain	James Rollins	19	I was edge the whole time reading this one.  My only critique is that the endless cliff-hangers got a little tiring by the end.
Lord of the Flies	William Golding	18	The chaos seemed to find no end. Golding does a good job showing how hard it can be to understand the minds of young boys.
Moby Dick	Herman Mellville	15	Long and meandering.  I think I may have had the wrong attitude when I read it.  Would recommend to retirees.
